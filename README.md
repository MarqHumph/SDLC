How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?

A graphic designer must deal with a similar problem. Their answer to this is to draw a bunch of small rough sketches and communicate ask the customer which sketches are closest to what they want. I think the premise is somewhat similar in software development where instead of rough sketches, the dev team gives plenty of opportunities for the customer to test the product and get their opinions. I think a good start for this is to ask what features and mechanics the customer wants in the product. These features can then be translated into a ‘user story’ where the feature is described in a more clear and easy-to-understand format for the developers to work towards and keep track of. Throughout development, frequent communication and frequent testing with the customer are important.

How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?

It will be important for me to ask questions when I am unclear about something. For example, if a user story happens to have something about it that could be interpreted differently, I would ask for clarification. I would also be willing to listen to any constructive criticism from the testers, product owner, customer, etc. I really like the concept of a sprint retrospective because it allows the team to look at their work in the past and think about how they could improve. This is important to grow and improve as a developer. I think daily standups are also important for that extra communication between the team and helps get everyone in the mindset of what needs to be done.

What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?

To me a good team member is one who is constantly striving to improve their skills, takes ownership in the tasks they take on, communicates to the team on their progress, and can jump in to help other members when they can.
